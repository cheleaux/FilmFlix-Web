# FilmFlix - Movie Box-set Curator Tool

[Go to FilmFLix](https://filmflix-lfnr.onrender.com/)


A web application to create and store your favourite titles made in Python, Flask, and JavaScript. Add as many movies as you want and access them easily through the open registries with filter and sorting features. You can use the collection curator tool to manage and create box sets and see only those movies in the registry as needed.


**For accessibility reasons, the register can be formatted to display list items less compactly at the cost of having to scroll further due to the bigger text.** 


## To Be Added
- User accounts so that each user's registry is personalized and box sets are private. 
- IMDB API look-up, to avoid users needing to add movie data themselves.
- Movie rating and review systems
